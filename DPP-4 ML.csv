The synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a new DPP-IV inhibitor class, N-substituted-glycyl-2-cyanopyrrolidines, are described as well as the path that led from clinical development compound 1-[2-[5-cyanopyridin-2-yl)amino]ethylamino]acetyl-2-cyano-(S)-pyrrolidine (NVP-DPP728, 8c) to its follow-up, 1-[[(3-hydroxy-1-adamantyl) amino]acetyl]-2-cyano-(S)-pyrrolidine (NVP-LAF237, 12j). The pharmacological profile of 12j in obese Zucker fa/fa rats along with pharmacokinetic profile comparison of 8c and 12j in normal cynomolgus monkeys is discussed. The results suggest that 12j is a potent, stable, selective DPP-IV inhibitor possessing excellent oral bioavailability and potent antihyperglycemic activity with potential for once-a-day administration.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

1943596,87,Confirmatory,Inhibition of DPP-4 (unknown origin),"Title: A review upon medicinal perspective and designing rationale of DPP-4 inhibitors._||_Abstract: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is one of the highly prevalence disorder and increasing day by day worldwidely. T2DM is a metabolic disorder, which is characterized by deficiency in insulin or resistance to insulin and thus increases the glucose levels in the blood. Various approaches are there to treat diabetes but still there is no cure for this disease. DPP-4 inhibitor is a privileged target in the field of drug discovery and provides various opportunities in exploring this target for development of molecules as antidiabetic agents. DPP-4 acts by inhibiting the incretin action and thus decreases the level of blood glucose by imparting minimal side effects. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin etc. are the different DPP-4 based drugs approved throughout the world for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Cyanopyrrolidines, triazolopiperazine amide, pyrrolidines are basic core nucleus present in various DPP-4 inhibitors and has potential effects. In the past few years, researchers had applied various approaches to synthesize potent DPP-4 inhibitors as antidiabetic agent without side effects like weight gain, cardiovascular risks, retinopathy etc. This review will also emphasize the recent strategies and rationale utilized by researchers for the development of DPP-4 inhibitors. This review also reveals about the various other approaches like molecular modelling, ligand based drug designing, high throughput screening etc. are used by the various research group for the development of potential DPP-4 inhibitors.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 46_||_First Page: 116354_||_Last Page: 116354_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2021.116354_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5247172,20240503,20240503,4369359|9571107|9835053|10144962|11450633|24999327|44182505|44572718|44572719|46209134|46209244|46209246|46871723|46891193|49165581|49797514|66561873|66561874|70682667|70688965|70691070|70693200|70695278|70697292|71474656|71474657|71474658|71474700|71732741|71732743|71732745|71732748|71732828|71732830|71732832|71733119|72697059|72697061|72697063|72697209|72697210|72697355|72697356|72697358|89488720|118796607|118796608|118796611|127035243|129076757|132069286|145975568|145984069|171342317|171342630|171343380|171343761|171344663|171345294|171345845|171347589|171348665|171349447|171349481|171349502|171349991|171350302|171350657|171350806|171351151|171352775|171352965|171353035|171353415|171353549|171353627|171354104|171354406|171354506|171354715|171355033|171355844|171356181|171356259|171357664|171358695,103165376|103440981|103450918|103502876|103516453|103611527|103612140|103612141|103758733|103758874|103758875|160670262|160675597|160686231|160691715|160697137|160697140|160702516|160707758|194138551|194138555|194166278|194179998|194179999|194186755|194186756|194186761|318403898|336881039|336881040|336881848|336881849|374354219|404690260|404703085|494394400|494394758|494395227|494396414|494396979|494397586|494398002|494398396|494399375|494400228|494402723|494402858|494403146|494404907|494406223|494406273|494406298|494406494|494407105|494407671|494407741|494408271|494408291|494408548|494409103|494410847|494411522|494411570|494411904|494412271|494412380|494413058|494413075|494413402|494413525|494414346|494414602|494414977|494415130|494415503|494415537|494416011|494416352|494417453|494417505|494418110|494418221|494418272|494420834|494423837|494424253|494424291,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34428715,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",83,"","",10.1016/j.bmc.2021.116354,"",26475371,"Kumar S, Mittal A, Mittal A.

These compounds were shown to be nanomolar DPP8/9 inhibitors with modest overall selectivity toward DPP IV and DPP II.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

It has been convincingly linked to multiple disease states involving remodeling of the extracellular matrix. FAP inhibition is investigated as a therapeutic option for several of these diseases, with most attention so far devoted to oncology applications. We previously discovered the N-4-quinolinoyl-Gly-(2S)-cyanoPro scaffold as a possible entry to highly potent and selective FAP inhibitors. In the present study, we explore in detail the structure-activity relationship around this core scaffold. We report extensively optimized compounds that display low nanomolar inhibitory potency and high selectivity against the related dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) DPPIV, DPP9, DPPII, and prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP). The log D values, plasma stabilities, and microsomal stabilities of selected compounds were found to be highly satisfactory. Pharmacokinetic evaluation in mice of selected inhibitors demonstrated high oral bioavailability, plasma half-life, and the potential to selectively and completely inhibit FAP in vivo.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

X-ray crystallography data show that these inhibitors bind to the catalytic site of DPPIV with the cyano group forming a covalent bond with the serine residue of DPPIV. The C5-substituents make various interactions with the enzyme and affect potency, chemical stability, selectivity, and PK properties of the inhibitors. Optimized analogues are extremely potent with subnanomolar K(i)'s, are chemically stable, show very little potency decrease in the presence of plasma, and exhibit more than 1,000-fold selectivity against related peptidases. The best compounds also possess good PK and are efficacious in lowering blood glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test in ZDF rats.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Herein, we report the discovery of a novel potent DPP-4 inhibitor with 3H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4(5H)-one as skeleton. After efficient optimization of the lead compound 2a at the 7- and 8-positions using a docking study, we found 28 as a novel DPP-4 inhibitor with excellent selectivity against various DPP-4 homologues. Compound 28 showed strong DPP-4 inhibitory activity compared to marketed DPP-4 inhibitors. We also found that a carboxyl group at the 7-position could interact with the residue of Lys554 to form a salt bridge. Additionally, introduction of a carboxyl group to 7-position led to both activity enhancement and reduced risk for hERG channel inhibition and induced phospholipidosis. In our synthesis of compounds with 7-carboxyl group, we achieved efficient regioselective synthesis using bulky ester in the intramolecular palladium coupling reaction.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

A novel series of cis-2,5-dicyanopyrrolidine alpha-amino amides were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 1-({[1-(Hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl]amino}acetyl)pyrrolidine-2,5-cis-dicarbonitrile (1c) is an achiral, slow-binding (time-dependent) inhibitor of DPP-IV that is selective for DPP-IV over other DPP isozymes and proline specific serine proteases, and which has oral bioavailability in preclinical species and in vivo efficacy in animal models. The mode of binding of the cis-2,5-dicyanopyrrolidine moiety was determined by X-ray crystallography.

Specifically, the influence of (1) the choice of the N-acyl group and (2) structural modification of the 2-cyanopyrrolidine residue were investigated. The inhibitors displayed inhibitory potency in the micromolar to nanomolar range and showed good to excellent selectivity with respect to the proline selective dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) DPP IV, DPP9 and DPP II. Additionally, selectivity for FAP with respect to prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) is reported. Not unexpectedly, the latter data suggest significant overlap in the pharmacophoric features that define FAP or PREP-inhibitory activity and underscore the importance of systematically evaluating the FAP/PREP-selectivity index for inhibitors of either of these two enzymes.

FAP expression is undetectable in most normal adult tissues, but is greatly upregulated in sites of tissue remodeling, which include fibrosis, inflammation and cancer. Due to its restricted expression pattern and dual enzymatic activities, FAP inhibition is investigated as a therapeutic option for several diseases. In the present study, we described the structure-activity relationship of several synthesized compounds against DPPIV and prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP). In particular, BR102910 (compound 24) showed nanomolar potency and high selectivity. Moreover, the in vivo FAP inhibition study of BR102910 (compound 24) using C57BL/6J mice demonstrated exceptional profiles and satisfactory FAP inhibition efficacy. Based on excellent in vitro and in vivo profiles, the potential of BR102910 (compound 24) as a lead candidate for the treatment of type 2 diabetes is considered.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg Med Chem Lett_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 37_||_First Page: 127846_||_Last Page: 127846_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2021.127846_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4714147,20220318,20220830,6918572|71621488|71655266|155754525|155754551|155754558|155754593|155754599|155754620|155754644|155754698|155754702|155754721|155754722|155754752|155754761|155754787|155754825|155754828|155754849|155754891|155754902|155754909|155754925|155754933|155754952|155754995|155755003|155755014|155755017|155755037|155755073|155755080|155755133|155755147|155755148|162646854|162650264|162651302|162663511,103259004|164137747|242620604|461515697|461517558|461517740|461519283|461519921|461521297|461524118|461524122|461524243|461524465|461524821|461524931|461525259|461525320|461526354|461528826|461529944|461530321|461533027|461534047|461534796|461536954|461538499|461538672|461539017|461539556|461543679|461543709|461543762|461548482|461550359|461551661|461551872|461554389|461554439|461560642|461562550,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33571650,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",4,"","",10.1016/j.bmcl.2021.127846,"",2648096,"Jung HJ, Nam EH, Park JY, Ghosh P, Kim IS.

A series of [(S)-gamma-(arylamino)prolyl]thiazolidine compounds in which the electrophilic nitrile is removed are chemically stable DPP-IV inhibitors. To discover a structure for the gamma-substituent of the proline moiety more suitable for interacting with the S(2) pocket of DPP-IV, optimization focused on the gamma-substituent was carried out. The indoline compound 22e showed a DPP-IV-inhibitory activity 100-fold more potent than that of the prolylthiazolidine 10 and comparable to that of NVP-DPP728. It also displayed improved inhibitory selectivity for DPP-IV over DPP8 and DPP9 compared to compound 10. Indoline compounds such as 22e have a rigid conformation with double restriction of the aromatic moiety by proline and indoline structures to promote interaction with the binding site in the S(2) pocket of DPP-IV. The double restriction effect provides a potent inhibitory activity which compensates for the decrease in activity caused by removing the electrophilic nitrile.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Esters of the carboxyl analogs exhibited a significant DPP-4 potency loss albeit with enhanced oral absorption. Herein, we described identification and structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration of a novel series of benzoic acid and ester derivatives as low single-digit nanomolar DPP-4 inhibitors. Importantly, the esters displayed comparable activities to the acids counterparts. Molecular simulation revealed that ester adopts a similar binding mode to acid. Moreover, the selected esters and acids demonstrated high selectivity and low cytotoxicity, as well as good metabolic stability. And more importantly, the esters possessed excellent pharmacokinetic profiles for oral administration. The best compound ester 19b demonstrated long DPP-4 inhibition in vivo, and robustly improved the glucose tolerance in normal and db/db mice while ensuring glucose-lowering potency in chronic treatment.

Currently there are no FAP inhibitors with reported selectivity toward both the closely related dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) and prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP). We present the discovery of a new class of FAP inhibitors with a N-(4-quinolinoyl)-Gly-(2-cyanopyrrolidine) scaffold. We have explored the effects of substituting the quinoline ring and varying the position of its sp(2) hybridized nitrogen atom. The most promising inhibitors combined low nanomolar FAP inhibition and high selectivity indices (>10(3)) with respect to both the DPPs and PREP.

FAP inhibition is expected to become a new antitumor target. Most known FAP inhibitors often resemble the dipeptide cleavage products, with a boroproline at the P1 site; however, these inhibitors also inhibit DPP-IV, DPP-II, DPP8, and DPP9. Potent and selective FAP inhibitor is needed in evaluating that FAP as a therapeutic target. Therefore, it is important to develop selective FAP inhibitors for the use of target validation. To achieve this, optimization of the nonselective DPP-IV inhibitor 8 led to the discovery of a new class of substituted 4-carboxymethylpyroglutamic acid diamides as FAP inhibitors. SAR studies resulted in a number of FAP inhibitors having IC(50) of <100 nM with excellent selectivity over DPP-IV, DPP-II, DPP8, and DPP9 (IC(50) > 100 μM). Compounds 18a, 18b, and 19 are the only known potent and selective FAP inhibitors, which prompts us to further study the physiological role of FAP.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Further study revealed that by replacing the aryl substitution on the imidazole ring with a more polar carboxylic ester or amide, these compounds displayed not only increased DPP4 binding activity but also significantly reduced human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) and sodium channel inhibitory activities. Additional incremental adjustment of polarity led to permeable molecules which exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in preclinical animal species. The active site binding mode of these compounds was determined by X-ray crystallography as exemplified by amide 24c.

Pronounced PREP specificity within the group of Clan SC proteases was generally observed. Omission of the P1 electrophilic function did not affect the overall binding mode of three representative compounds, as studied by X-ray crystallography, while the P2 substituents were demonstrated to be accommodated in a cavity of PREP that, to date, has not been probed by inhibitors.

The availability of a DPP8-selective compound would be highly instrumental for studying and untwining the biological roles of DPP8 and DPP9 and for the disambiguation of biological effects of nonselective DPP-inhibitors that have mainly been ascribed to blocking of DPPIV's action. The cell-permeable DPP8/9-inhibitor 7 was selected as a lead and dissected into several substructures that were modified separately for evaluating their potential to contribute to selectivity. The obtained results, together with earlier work from our group, clearly narrow down the most probable DPP8-selectivity imparting modification points in DPP8/9 inhibitors to parts of space that are topologically equivalent to the piperazine ring system in 7. This information can be considered of high value for future design of compounds with maximal DPP8 selectivity.",Journal: J. Med.

Most known DPP-IV inhibitors often resemble the dipeptide cleavage products, with a proline mimic at the P1 site. As off-target inhibitions of DPP8 and/or DPP9 have shown profound toxicities in the in vivo studies, it is important to develop selective DPP-IV inhibitors for clinical usage. To achieve this, a new class of 2-[3-[[2-[(2S)-2-cyano-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-oxoethyl]amino]-1-oxopropyl]-based DPP-IV inhibitors was synthesized. SAR studies resulted in a number of DPP-IV inhibitors, having IC(50) values of <50 nM with excellent selectivity over both DPP8 (IC(50) > 100 microM) and DPP-II (IC(50) > 30 microM). Compound 21a suppressed the blood glucose elevation after an oral glucose challenge in Wistar rats and also inhibited plasma DPP-IV activity for up to 4 h in BALB/c mice. The results show that compound 21a possesses in vitro and in vivo activities comparable to those of NVP-LAF237 (4), which is in clinical development.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Herein, with scaffold hopping and fragment-based drug design strategies, highly potent and selective pyrazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidine DPP-4 inhibitors were found featured by reduced or diminished cytotoxicity. Specifically, c24 (IC = 2 nM) exhibits a 25 to 40-fold increase of inhibitory activity respect to those of b2 and d1, respectively, 2-fold from Alogliptin (IC = 4 nM), and remarkable selectivity over DPP-8 and DPP-9 (>2000 fold). Further docking studies confirmed that the pyrazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidine core interacts with the S1 pocket whereas its substituted aromatic ring interacts with the sub-S1 pocket. The interactive mode in this case resembles that of Alogliptin and Trelagliptin. Further in vivo IPGTT assays in diabetic mice demonstrated that c24 effectively reduces glucose excursion by 48% at the dose of 10 mg/kg, suggesting that c24 is worthy of further development as a potent anti-diabetes agent.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2020_||_Volume: 208_||_First Page: 112850_||_Last Page: 112850_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112850_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4711280,20220318,20220830,11450633|162643215|162645980|162646625|162648734|162649396|162651915|162652480|162653184|162653539|162654799|162654872|162660080|162660902|162661309|162661497|162661787|162663995|162664794|162666659|162667529|162668329|162671800|162674061|162674329|162675020|162675125|162677097,103516453|461514821|461518737|461519590|461522632|461523578|461527248|461528030|461529020|461529511|461531324|461531424|461538770|461539931|461540586|461540849|461541266|461544411|461545527|461548238|461549487|461550628|461555563|461558733|461559120|461560094|461560253|461563029,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32987315,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",17,"","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112850,"",12921471,"Shen J, Deng X, Sun R, Tavallaie MS, Wang J, Cai Q, Lam C, Lei S, Fu L, Jiang F.

In our study, 3D pharmacophore models were generated using a training set of 22 DPP-IV inhibitors. The best model consisted of important chemical features and mapped well into the active site of DPP-IV. The model gave high correlation coefficients of 0.97 and 0.84 for the training set and the test set, respectively, showing its good predictive ability for biological activity. Furthermore, the pharmacophore model demonstrated the capability to retrieve inhibitors from database with a high enrichment factor of 42.58.

393688,25,Confirmatory,Inhibition of DPP4,"Title: Medicinal chemistry approaches to the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes._||_Abstract: Emerging as an epidemic of the 21st century type 2 diabetes has become a major health problem throughout the globe. The number of deaths attributable to diabetes reflects the insufficient glycemic control achieved with the treatments used in recent past. DPP-4 inhibitors have been investigated as a new therapy with novel mechanisms of action and improved tolerability. DPP-4, a protease that specifically cleaves dipeptides from proteins and oligopeptides after a penultimate N-terminal proline or alanine, is involved in the degradation of a number of neuropeptides, peptide hormones and cytokines, including the incretins GLP-1 and GIP. As soon as released from the gut in response to food intake, GLP-1 and GIP exert a potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic action, thereby playing a key role in the maintenance of post-meal glycemic control. Consequently, inhibiting DPP-4 prolongs the action of GLP-1 and GIP, which in turn improves glucose homeostasis with a low risk of hypoglycemia and potential for disease modification. Indeed, clinical trials involving diabetic patients have shown improved glucose control by administering DPP-4 inhibitors, thus demonstrating the benefit of this promising new class of antidiabetics. Intense research activities in this area have resulted in the launch of sitagliptin and vildagliptin (in Europe only) and the advancement of a few others into preregistration/phase 3, for example, saxagliptin, alogliptin and ABT-279. Achieving desired selectivity for DPP-4 over other related peptidases such as DPP-8 and DPP-9 (inhibition of which was linked to toxicity in animal studies) and long-acting potential for maximal efficacy (particularly in more severe diabetic patients) were the major challenges. Whether these goals are achieved with the present series of inhibitors in the advanced stages of clinical development is yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, treatment of this metabolic disorder especially in the early stages of the disease via DPP-4 inhibition has been recognized as a validated principle and a large number of inhibitors are presently in various stage of pre-clinical/clinical development.

We explored linked bicyclic heteroarylpiperazines substituted at the γ-position of the proline structure in the course of the investigation of l-prolylthiazolidines. The efforts led to the discovery of a highly potent, selective, long-lasting and orally active DPP-4 inhibitor, 3-[(2S,4S)-4-[4-(3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]pyrrolidin-2-ylcarbonyl]thiazolidine (8 g), which has a unique structure characterized by five consecutive rings. An X-ray co-crystal structure of 8 g in DPP-4 demonstrated that the key interaction between the phenyl ring on the pyrazole and the S(2) extensive subsite of DPP-4 not only boosted potency, but also increased selectivity. Compound 8 g, at 0.03 mg/kg or higher doses, significantly inhibited the increase of plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose load in Zucker fatty rats.

We hypothesized that the 4-phenyl group of the isoquinolone occupies the S1 pocket of the enzyme, the 3-aminomethyl group forms an electrostatic interaction with the S2 pocket, and the introduction of a hydrogen bond donor onto the 6- or 7-substituent provides interaction with the hydrophilic region of the enzyme. Based on this hypothesis, intensive research focused on developing new non-peptide DPP-4 inhibitors has been carried out. Among the compounds designed in this study, we identified 2-[(3-aminomethyl-2-(2-methylpropyl)-1-oxo-4-phenyl-1,2-dihydro-6-isoquinolinyl)oxy]acetamide (35a) as a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable DPP-4 inhibitor, which exhibited in vivo efficacy in diabetic model rats. Finally, X-ray crystallography of 35a in a complex with the enzyme validated our hypothesized binding mode and identified Lys554 as a new target-binding site available for DPP-4 inhibitors.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Analogues that incorporated a bulky substituent at the first carbon position of benzylamine or isoquinoline showed over 30-fold selectivity for DPP-IV over both DPP8 and DPP-II. From structure-activity relationship studies, we speculate that the S2 site of DPP8 might be similar to that of DPP-IV, while DPP-IV inhibitor with N-substituted glycine in the P2 site and/or with a moiety involving in hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of Phe357 might provide a better selectivity for DPP-IV over DPP8.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

1281871,23,Literature-derived,Half life of compound assessed as recombinant human DPP4-mediated cleavage by RP-HPLC analysis,"Title: A new GLP-1 analogue with prolonged glucose-lowering activity in vivo via backbone-based modification at the N-terminus._||_Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an endogenous insulinotropic hormone with wonderful glucose-lowering activity. However, its clinical use in type II diabetes is limited due to its rapid degradation at the N-terminus by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Among the N-terminal modifications of GLP-1, backbone-based modification was rarely reported. Herein, we employed two backbone-based strategies to modify the N-terminus of tGLP-1. Firstly, the amide N-methylated analogues 2-6 were designed and synthesized to make a full screening of the N-terminal amide bonds, and the loss of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation indicated the importance of amide H-bonds. Secondly, with retaining the N-terminal amide H-bonds, the β-peptide replacement strategy was used and analogues 7-13 were synthesized. By two rounds of screening, analogue 10 was identified.

In our continuous effort to find better glucose-lowering agents, an exploration for long-acting DPP-4 inhibitors had been launched. Based on our previously reported compounds bearing a pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold, the lead compound 4a (IC50 = 2.3 nM, t1/2(rat) = 5.46 h) with pharmacokinetic superiority was rapidly determined. Further SAR study indicated that the pyrrole ring was generally tolerable for variation, in which a β-substitution gave a better DPP-4 affinity. In depth evaluation of the pyrrole ring β position identified a highly potent compound 12a (IC50 = 0.76 nM, t1/2(rat) = 7.89 h). In vivo pharmacodynamics tests demonstrated similar or even slightly better sustained DPP-4 inhibition for compounds 4a and 12a compared with the first marketed once-weekly drug trelagliptin in this category, indicating that improvements to DPP-4 inhibitory activity or pharmacokinetic profile might be feasible ways to rapidly generate long-acting DPP-4 inhibitors.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2017_||_Volume: 141_||_First Page: 519_||_Last Page: 529_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.10.029_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4140929,20200623,20220830,"","",1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29078995,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",21,"","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2017.10.029,"",18905607,"Xie H, Zeng S, He Y, Zhang G, Yu P, Zhong G, Xu H, Yang L, Wang S, Zhao X, Hu W.

The synthesis of a series of diaryl 1-(S)-prolylpyrrolidine-2(R,S)-phosphonates with different substituents on the aryl rings (hydroxyl, methoxy, acylamino, sulfonylamino, ureyl, methoxycarbonyl, and alkylaminocarbonyl) started from the corresponding phosphites. A good correlation was found between the electronic properties of the substituent and the inhibitory activity and stability. The most striking divergence of this correlation was the high potency combined with a high stability of the 4-acetylamino-substituted derivative 11e. This compound shows low cytotoxicity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and also has favorable properties in vivo. Therefore bis(4-acetamidophenyl) 1-(S)-prolylpyrrolidine-2(R,S)-phosphonate (11e) is considered as a major improvement and will be a highly valuable DPP IV inhibitor for further studies on the biological function of the enzyme and the therapeutic value of its inhibition.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

After systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study around benzoic acid moieties, 5 novel DPP-4 inhibitors with low picomolar potency range (IC<sub>50</sub> < 1 nM) and excellent selectivity against various DPP-4 homologues were identified, in which the best one, compound 2f, with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.1 nM for DPP-4, showed 22-fold improvement in inhibitory activity compared to lead compound uracil 1, its activity was 45-fold more potent than alogliptin. 2e, 2f, 2i and 2k were selected for pharmacokinetic evaluation, and 2f and 2i showed the better pharmacokinetic profiles after iv administration, but poor oral bioavailability. To improve the oral pharmacokinetic profile, prodrug design approach was performed around 2f and 2i. Esters of 2f and 2i were synthesized and evaluated for stability, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. Compound 3e, the methyl ester of compound 2f, was identified to demonstrate good stability, low toxicity and improved oral bioavailability, with 3-fold higher blood concentration compared to 2f in rats. The following in vivo evaluations revealed 3e provided a sustained pharmacodynamics effect for 48h, and robustly improved glucose tolerance in normal ICR and db/db mice in dose-dependent manner. Chronic treatments investigations demonstrated that 3e achieved more beneficial effects on fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance than alogliptin in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. The overall results have shown that compound 3e has the potential to efficacious, safety and long-acting treatment for T2DM.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2019_||_Volume: 180_||_First Page: 509_||_Last Page: 523_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.07.045_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4368093,20210302,20220830,"","",1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31336309,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,521,"",22,"","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2019.07.045,"",21648077,"Li Q, Meng L, Zhou S, Deng X, Wang N, Ji Y, Peng Y, Xing J, Yao G.

In this study, we obtained the X-ray co-crystal structure between nicotinic acid derivative 1 and DPP-4. From these X-ray co-crystallography results, to achieve more potent inhibitory activity, we targeted Arg125 as a potential amino acid residue because it was located near the pyridine core, and some known DPP-4 inhibitors were reported to interact with this residue. We hypothesized that the guanidino group of Arg125 could interact with two hydrogen-bond acceptors in a bidentate manner. Therefore, we designed a series of 3-pyridylacetamide derivatives possessing an additional hydrogen-bond acceptor that could have the desired bidentate interaction with Arg125. We discovered the dihydrochloride of 1-{[5-(aminomethyl)-2-methyl-4-(4-methylphenyl)-6-(2-methylpropyl)pyridin-3-yl]acetyl}-l-prolinamide (13j) to be a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor that could interact with the guanidino group of Arg125 in a unique bidentate manner.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

X-ray crystallography data show that these inhibitors bind to the catalytic site of DPPIV with the cyano group forming a covalent bond with the serine residue of DPPIV. The C5-substituents make various interactions with the enzyme and affect potency, chemical stability, selectivity, and PK properties of the inhibitors. Optimized analogues are extremely potent with subnanomolar K(i)'s, are chemically stable, show very little potency decrease in the presence of plasma, and exhibit more than 1,000-fold selectivity against related peptidases.

To date there has been no DPP-4 chemotype possessing a carboxy group that has progressed into clinical trials. Originating from the discovery of the structurally novel quinoline derivative 1, we designed novel pyridine derivatives containing a carboxy group. In our design, the carboxy group interacted with the targeted amino acid residues around the catalytic region and thereby increased the inhibitory activity. After further optimization, we identified a hydrate of [5-(aminomethyl)-6-(2,2-dimethylpropyl)-2-ethyl-4-(4-methylphenyl)pyridin-3-yl]acetic acid (30c) as a potent and selective DPP-4 inhibitor. The desired interactions with the critical active-site residues, such as a salt-bridge interaction with Arg125, were confirmed by X-ray cocrystal structure analysis. In addition, compound 30c showed a desired preclinical safety profile, and it was encoded as TAK-100.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is also an attractive way to tackle type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We showed previously that azoloazine heterocycles have the potential to prevent the formation of AGEs and in this work, we conducted docking studies with DPP-4 of 5-alkylamino-6-nitro-1,3,4-thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidines. Consequently, we have developed a synthetic approach to these structures by chlorodeoxygenation and amination reactions. Antidiabetic properties of obtained compounds were studied by evaluating DPP-4 (ex vivo/in vitro) and AGEs formation inhibition (in vitro). It was shown that the nitrothiadiazolopyrimidines exhibit a higher antiglycation activity than reference compound aminoguanidine, but only moderate inhibition of DPP-4. The most active DPP-4 inhibitor 1l had IC50 of 55.87 μM and showed the ability to inhibit serum DPP-4 activity in rats after 10 mg/kg oral administration but with the less and shorter effect than vildagliptin. At the same time, 1l was the most active antiglycating compound in the series (IC50 134.4 μM). Copper chelation properties of synthesized compounds were also investigated since the formation of AGEs is catalyzed by the transition metal cations. A noticeable correlation between antiglycation activity and metal chelation was revealed. Both activities (antiglycation and copper chelation) correlated with quantum-chemical properties (calculated with ab initio) of the tested compounds.

Variation of the P2 position of Xaa-boroPro dipeptides._||_Abstract: A series of prolineboronic acid (boroPro) containing dipeptides were synthesized and assayed for their ability to inhibit the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). Inhibitory activity, which requires the (R)-stereoisomer of boroPro in the P1 position, appears to tolerate a variety of L-amino acids in the P2 position. Substitution at the P2 position which is not tolerated include the D-amino acids, alpha,alpha-disubstituted amino acids, and glycine. Specificity against DPPII and proline specific endopeptidase is reported. A correlation between the ability to inhibit DPPIV in cell culture and in the human mixed lymphocyte reaction is demonstrated. A synthesis of prolineboronic acid is reported as well as conditions for generating the fully unprotected boronic acid dipeptides in either their cyclic or acyclic forms.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Despite poor systemic exposure, vinyl-substituted compounds showed extended duration of action in acute rat ex vivo plasma DPP-IV inhibition models. Oxygenated putative metabolites were prepared and were shown to exhibit the potency and extended duration of action of their precursors in efficacy models measuring glucose clearance in Zucker(fa/fa) rats.

The biological function of DPP8 is not known. To identify potent and selective chemical compounds against DPP8, we have synthesized a series of isoquinoline and isoindoline derivatives and have tested their inhibitory activity against DPP8, DPP-IV and DPP-II. Isoindoline derivatives were found to be more potent DPP8 inhibitors than isoquinoline derivatives. Isoindoline with a 1-(4,4'-difluor-benzhydryl)-piperazine group at the P2 site was observed to be a very potent DPP8 inhibitor, having an IC(50) value of 14nM with at least a 2500-fold selectivity over either DPP-IV or DPP-II. From SAR results, we speculate that the S1 site of DPP8 may be larger than that of DPP-IV, which would allow the accommodation of larger C-terminal residues, such as isoquinoline or isoindoline.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a new promising target during type 2 diabetes glycemic control. Thus, a number of potent DPP-4 inhibitors were developed and play a rapidly evolving role in the management of type 2 diabetes in recent years. This article reviews the development of synthetic and natural DPP-4 inhibitors from 2012 to 2017 and provides their physico-chemical properties, biological activities against DPP-4 and selectivity over dipeptidyl peptidase-8/9. Moreover, the glucose-lowering mechanisms and the active site of DPP-4 are also discussed. We also discuss strategies and structure-activity relationships for identifying potent DPP-4 inhibitors, which will provide useful information for developing potent DPP-4 drugs as type 2 diabtes treatments.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 151_||_First Page: 145_||_Last Page: 157_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.041_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4232373,20200619,20220830,370|10680|65064|68247|69512|72281|83489|94701|439246|441667|445154|689043|5280343|5280443|5280445|5280863|5280961,103165116|103166132|103167027|103168452|103180510|103198532|103206920|103207220|103217472|103226312|103259583|103496925|103558713|103574339|103724071|123083187|163317382,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29609120,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",15,"","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.03.041,"",1922001,"Li N, Wang L, Jiang B, Li X, Guo C, Guo S, Shi D.

Considering the downsides of multidrug therapies and the relevance of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) and carbonic anhydrases (CAs II and V) in T2DM and in the weight loss, we report a new class of multitarget ligands targeting the mentioned enzymes. We started from the known α<sub>1</sub>-AR inhibitor WB-4101, which was progressively modified through a tailored morphing strategy to optimize the potency of DPP IV and CAs while losing the adrenergic activity. The obtained compound <b>12</b> shows a satisfactory DPP IV inhibition with a good selectivity CA profile (DPP IV IC<sub>50</sub>: 0.0490 μM; CA II <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> 0.2615 μM; CA VA <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> 0.0941 μM; CA VB <i>K<sub>i</sub></i> 0.0428 μM).

Thus, a pharmacophore hybridization of Alogliptin was initiated and led to a novel DPP-IV inhibitor, 11a. Although it did not exhibit the desired activity (IC50=0.2 μM), compound 11a acts as a lead compound, which triggered a resulting structural optimization and the formation of compound 11m. A novel series of potent DPP-IV inhibitors represented by compound 11m (IC50=0.4 nM) was ultimately obtained with a robust pharmacokinetic profile and superior in vitro and in vivo efficacy compared to Alogliptin.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur.

1281878,13,Literature-derived,Drug degradation assessed as recombinant human DPP4-mediated cleavage by measuring compound remaining after 12 hrs by RP-HPLC analysis,"Title: A new GLP-1 analogue with prolonged glucose-lowering activity in vivo via backbone-based modification at the N-terminus._||_Abstract: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an endogenous insulinotropic hormone with wonderful glucose-lowering activity. However, its clinical use in type II diabetes is limited due to its rapid degradation at the N-terminus by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Among the N-terminal modifications of GLP-1, backbone-based modification was rarely reported. Herein, we employed two backbone-based strategies to modify the N-terminus of tGLP-1. Firstly, the amide N-methylated analogues 2-6 were designed and synthesized to make a full screening of the N-terminal amide bonds, and the loss of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation indicated the importance of amide H-bonds. Secondly, with retaining the N-terminal amide H-bonds, the β-peptide replacement strategy was used and analogues 7-13 were synthesized. By two rounds of screening, analogue 10 was identified. Analogue 10 greatly improved the DPP-IV resistance with maintaining good GLP-1R activation in vitro, and showed approximately a 4-fold prolonged blood glucose-lowering activity in vivo in comparison with tGLP-1. This modification strategy will benefit the development of GLP-1-based anti-diabetic drugs.",Journal: Bioorg. Med.

Even though several peptidomimetic compounds with nanomolar potency have been described, broad chemical space for further modification remained unexplored. Therefore, we set to analyze the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of pseudopeptide compound series with α-ketoamide warheads in order to explore the contributions of the P1' and P2' moieties to the inhibitory potency. A series of novel inhibitors bearing varied P1' and/or P2' moieties was synthesized by combining a Passerini reaction-Amine Deprotection-Acyl Migration (PADAM) approach with peptide coupling and subsequent oxidation. The resulting compounds inhibited FAP and the related prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) with potencies in the nanomolar to sub-nanomolar range. The most potent FAP inhibitor IOCB22-AP446 (6d, IC<sub>50</sub> = 89 pM) had about 36-fold higher inhibition potency than the most potent inhibitor published to date.

DPP-4 inhibitor is a privileged target in the field of drug discovery and provides various opportunities in exploring this target for development of molecules as antidiabetic agents. DPP-4 acts by inhibiting the incretin action and thus decreases the level of blood glucose by imparting minimal side effects.

The in vitro screening of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activated activity, α-glucosidase inhibitory and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitory activities showed that the novel molecule M5 had efficient PPAR response element (PPRE) activated activity (PPRE relative activity 105.04% at 10 μg·mL-1 compared with the positive control pioglitazone, with 100% activity). Therefore, M5 was selected as the hit compound from which the TM3 and TM4 series of compounds were further designed and synthesized. Based on the PPRE relative activities of TM3 and TM4, we discovered another new molecule, TM4h, which had the strongest PPRE relative activity (120.42% at 10 μg·mL-1). In addition, the concentration-dependent activity of the highly active compounds was determined by assaying their half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values. The molecular physical parameter calculation and the molecular toxicity prediction were used to theoretically evaluate the lead-likeness and safety of the active compounds. In conclusion, we identified a potential PPARγ lead molecule and developed a tangible strategy for antidiabetic drug development.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 26_||_Issue: 14_||_First Page: 4153_||_Last Page: 4167_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2018.07.005_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4233584,20200619,20200619,145982886|145983022|145983839|145983947|145984304|145985125|145985205|145985480|145985789|145986010|145986192|145986194,404701436|404701628|404702766|404702917|404703425|404704546|404704661|404705074|404705514|404705827|404706097|404706099,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30001846,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","","","","",10.1016/j.bmc.2018.07.005,"",7444158,"Liu J, Su X, Li H, Fan L, Li Y, Tang X, Yan J, Chen X, Chen F, Liu J, Yang D.

DPP IV has high substrate selectivity for peptides with a proline (or an alanine) at the penultimate amino acid position at the N-terminus but tolerates a wide range of natural amino acids at the amino terminal end. A variety of dipeptidyl amide prodrugs of anti-HIV TSAO molecules were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to act as substrates for the enzyme. Our data revealed that DPP IV/CD26 can efficiently recognize such prodrugs as substrates, releasing the parent compound. Moreover, it is possible to modify the half-life and the lipophilicity of the prodrugs by changing the nature of the dipeptide. All conjugates have shown marked in vitro antiviral activities irrespective the the nature of the terminal and/or the penultimate amino acid moiety.",Journal: J. Med.

All the 1,2,3-triazole analogues exhibited moderate in vitro hDPP-4 inhibitory activities (265 ~ 780 nM). These results are somewhat less potent compared to those of known 1,2,3-triazole analogues (S1 ~ S6, 14 ~ 254 nM). S2 and S3 manifested excellent potency against hDPP-4 with ICs of 28 and 14 nM, respectively. The role of the 1,2,3-triazole moiety in binding the molecule to the target was investigated using combined 10 1,2,3-triazole analogues (S1 ~ S10). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations following the aforementioned docking phase were performed to elucidate potential binding modes of sitagliptin's 1,2,3-triazole analogues in hDPP-4, with the use of a cocrystal structure of hDPP-4 with sitagliptin (PDB ID: 1X70). Docking and MD simulations of the complexes of hDPP-4 with sitagliptin, S2 and S3 suggest that Glu205, Glu206, Tyr662, and Tyr666 would be the key amino acid residues for the binding of the molecules with the receptor. Especially, S2 and S3 showed additional strong π-π interaction between Phe357 and 1,2,3-triazole. Same strong π-π interaction is also observed between Phe357 and the 1,2,4-triazole ring of sitagliptin. Furthermore, additional interactions with Tyr547, Cys551, and especially Arg358 would enhance the binding affinity of the compounds for the pocket of the enzyme.

Anti-diabetic drugs are used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus to control glucose levels in the blood. Most of the drugs are administered orally, except for a few of them, such as insulin, exenatide, and pramlintide. In this review, we are going to discuss seven major types of anti-diabetic drugs: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors, aldose reductase inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitors. Here, we are also discussing some of the recently reported anti-diabetic agents with its multi-target pharmacological actions.

The alpha-ketoheterocycle functionality provides a moderately electrophilic ketone carbonyl with 'tunable' reactivity, as well as a structural template for introducing new interactions in the enzyme active-site cleft. This type of moiety has served an important role in the design of active-site-directed inhibitors of diverse serine and cysteine proteases, and of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). Potent inhibitors have been identified for, inter alia, elastase, thrombin, factor Xa, tryptase, chymase, cathepsin K, cathepsin S, and FAAH. For example, 6e is an orally active inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase that entered human clinical studies, 52h is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of human chymase, and 82m is a FAAH inhibitor with in vivo endocannabinoid-enhancing activity.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

Multifunctional compounds with hypoglycemic and endothelial protective action will be promising agents for the treatment of diabetes and its complications. In this study, a series of novel NO-donating sitagliptin derivatives and relevant metabolites were synthesized and evaluated as potential multifunctional hypoglycemic agents. All of synthetic compounds shown remarkable inhibitory activity against dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) in vitro and demonstrated excellent hypoglycemic activities in diabetic mice, similar to the activity of sitagliptin, and compounds T1-T4 shown different extents of NO-releasing abilities and potent antioxidant abilities in vivo. By screening in DPP-4, compound T4 was recognized as a potent DPP-4 inhibitor with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.060 μM. Docking study revealed compound T4 has a favorable binding mode. Furthermore, compounds T1-T4 exhibited different extents of NO-releasing abilities and excellent anti-platelet aggregation in vitro. The overall results suggested that T4 could help to the amelioration of endothelial dysfunction by reducing blood glucose, lessening oxidative stress and raising NO levels as well as inhibiting platelet aggregation. Based on this research, compound T4 deserves further investigation as potential new multifunctional anti-diabetic agent with antioxidant, anti-platelet aggregation and endothelial protective properties.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg Med Chem Lett_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 28_||_Issue: 23-24_||_First Page: 3731_||_Last Page: 3735_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.10.019_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4326781,20210302,20220830,"","",1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30343953,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",9,"","",10.1016/j.bmcl.2018.10.019,"",16925582,"Xie Y, Shao L, Wang Q, Bai Y, Chen Z, Li N, Xu Y, Li Y, Yang G, Bian X.

T2DM is a metabolic disorder, which is characterized by deficiency in insulin or resistance to insulin and thus increases the glucose levels in the blood. Various approaches are there to treat diabetes but still there is no cure for this disease. DPP-4 inhibitor is a privileged target in the field of drug discovery and provides various opportunities in exploring this target for development of molecules as antidiabetic agents. DPP-4 acts by inhibiting the incretin action and thus decreases the level of blood glucose by imparting minimal side effects. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin etc. are the different DPP-4 based drugs approved throughout the world for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Cyanopyrrolidines, triazolopiperazine amide, pyrrolidines are basic core nucleus present in various DPP-4 inhibitors and has potential effects. In the past few years, researchers had applied various approaches to synthesize potent DPP-4 inhibitors as antidiabetic agent without side effects like weight gain, cardiovascular risks, retinopathy etc. This review will also emphasize the recent strategies and rationale utilized by researchers for the development of DPP-4 inhibitors. This review also reveals about the various other approaches like molecular modelling, ligand based drug designing, high throughput screening etc. are used by the various research group for the development of potential DPP-4 inhibitors.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 46_||_First Page: 116354_||_Last Page: 116354_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2021.116354_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5247222,20240503,20240503,11450633|155518381|155523785|155549522|171342092|171345021|171348042|171353733|171355841,103516453|440121618|440130071|440179405|494394408|494398941|494403912|494413689|494417502,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34428715,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",9,"","",10.1016/j.bmc.2021.116354,"",26475371,"Kumar S, Mittal A, Mittal A.

Dipeptide boronic acids, among the first, and still among the most potent DPP-IV inhibitors known, suffer from a concern over their safety. Here we evaluate the potency, in vivo efficacy, and safety of a selected set of these inhibitors. The adverse effects induced by boronic acid-based DPP-IV inhibitors are essentially limited to what has been observed previously for non-boronic acid inhibitors and attributed to cross-reactivity with DPP8/9. While consistent with the DPP8/9 hypothesis, they are also consistent with cross-reactivity with some other intracellular target. The results further show that the potency of simple dipeptide boronic acid-based inhibitors can be combined with selectivity against DPP8/9 in vivo to produce agents with a relatively wide therapeutic index (>500) in rodents.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

While there have been some recent commercial successes fostered in part by advances in large-scale peptide synthesis, development of peptides as therapeutic agents has been significantly impeded by their inherent susceptibility to protease degradation in the bloodstream. Here we report that incorporation of specially designed amino acid analogues at the P1' position, directly C-terminal of the enzyme cleavage site, renders peptides, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) and six other examples, highly resistant to serine protease degradation without significant alteration of their biological activity. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to a variety of proteases, including dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8), fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα), α-lytic protease (αLP), trypsin, and chymotrypsin. In summary, the 'P1' modification' represents a simple, general, and highly adaptable method of generating enzymatically stable peptide-based therapeutics.",Journal: J. Med.

1501061,8,Confirmatory,Inhibition of human DPP4,"Title: Crystal structure of Porphyromonas gingivalis dipeptidyl peptidase 4 and structure-activity relationships based on inhibitor profiling._||_Abstract: The Gram-negative anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis is associated with chronic periodontitis. Clinical isolates of P. gingivalis strains with high dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) expression also had a high capacity for biofilm formation and were more infective. The X-ray crystal structure of P. gingivalis DPP4 was solved at 2.2 Å resolution. Despite a sequence identity of 32%, the overall structure of the dimer was conserved between P. gingivalis DPP4 and mammalian orthologues.

The rates of inhibition of DPP-IV by these compounds are moderate, but the inhibitors are quite specific. The best inhibitor in the series is Ala-PipP(OPh-4-Cl)2 (13), which has a k(inact) of 0.353 s-1 and KI of 236 microM. The DPP-IV inhibitors Ala-ProP(OPh)2 (6), Ala-ProP(OPh-4-Cl)2 (12), and Ala-PipP(OPh-4-Cl)2 (13) do not inhibit trypsin, human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), acetylcholinesterase, papain, and cathepsin B. However, compounds 12 and 13 inhibited chymotrypsin slowly. Most of these dipeptides containing a homoproline phosphonate residue (PipP) or a Pro phosphonate residue (ProP) at the P1 site are stable in a pH 7.8 buffer with half-lives of several hours to several days. DPP-IV inhibited by 6, 7 (Ala-PipP(OPh)2), 12, or 13 is quite stable, and no enzyme activity was recovered after removal of excess inhibitor and incubation in buffer for 1 day. Since the phosphonate inhibitors are specific toward DPP-IV and the inhibited enzymes are stable, they should be useful in establishing the biological functions of DPP-IV and may be useful therapeutically in the prevention of the rejection of transplanted tissue.",Journal: J.

393692,7,Confirmatory,Inhibition of human DPP4,"Title: Medicinal chemistry approaches to the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes._||_Abstract: Emerging as an epidemic of the 21st century type 2 diabetes has become a major health problem throughout the globe. The number of deaths attributable to diabetes reflects the insufficient glycemic control achieved with the treatments used in recent past. DPP-4 inhibitors have been investigated as a new therapy with novel mechanisms of action and improved tolerability. DPP-4, a protease that specifically cleaves dipeptides from proteins and oligopeptides after a penultimate N-terminal proline or alanine, is involved in the degradation of a number of neuropeptides, peptide hormones and cytokines, including the incretins GLP-1 and GIP. As soon as released from the gut in response to food intake, GLP-1 and GIP exert a potent glucose-dependent insulinotropic action, thereby playing a key role in the maintenance of post-meal glycemic control. Consequently, inhibiting DPP-4 prolongs the action of GLP-1 and GIP, which in turn improves glucose homeostasis with a low risk of hypoglycemia and potential for disease modification. Indeed, clinical trials involving diabetic patients have shown improved glucose control by administering DPP-4 inhibitors, thus demonstrating the benefit of this promising new class of antidiabetics. Intense research activities in this area have resulted in the launch of sitagliptin and vildagliptin (in Europe only) and the advancement of a few others into preregistration/phase 3, for example, saxagliptin, alogliptin and ABT-279. Achieving desired selectivity for DPP-4 over other related peptidases such as DPP-8 and DPP-9 (inhibition of which was linked to toxicity in animal studies) and long-acting potential for maximal efficacy (particularly in more severe diabetic patients) were the major challenges. Whether these goals are achieved with the present series of inhibitors in the advanced stages of clinical development is yet to be confirmed. Nevertheless, treatment of this metabolic disorder especially in the early stages of the disease via DPP-4 inhibition has been recognized as a validated principle and a large number of inhibitors are presently in various stage of pre-clinical/clinical development. Sitagliptin is a new weapon in the arsenal of oral antihyperglycemic agents. This review will focus on the journey of drug discovery of DPP-4 inhibitors for oral delivery covering a brief scientific background and medicinal chemistry approaches along with the status of advanced clinical candidates.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

It is widely believed to play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis and therefore to represent a potential new drug target for cancer. Investigation into its biological function, however, has been hampered by the current unavailability of selective inhibitors. The challenge has been in identifying inhibitors that are selective for FAP over both the dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs), with which it shares exopeptidase specificity, and prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP), with which it shares endopeptidase specificity. Here, we report the first potent FAP inhibitor with selectivity over both the DPPs and PREP, N-(pyridine-4-carbonyl)-d-Ala-boroPro (ARI-3099, 6). We also report a similarly potent and selective PREP inhibitor, N-(pyridine-3-carbonyl)-Val-boroPro (ARI-3531, 22). Both are boronic acid based inhibitors, demonstrating that high selectivity can be achieved using this electrophile. The inhibitors are stable, easy to synthesize, and should prove to be useful in helping to elucidate the biological functions of these two unique and interesting enzymes, as well as their potential as drug targets.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Structure based virtual screening (SBVS) of Molecular Diversity Preservation International (MDPI) database was performed using Glide and Gold against DPP-IV enzyme. Six promising hits were identified and tested for DPP-IV inhibition. Three compounds were found to be active at low micromolar concentration. The 3-(1-hydrazinyl-1-(phenylamino)ethyl)-4-hydroxy-1-methylquinolin-2(1H)-one (compound A) was found to be the most potent hit with an IC50 of 0.73 μM. These three compounds (A, B and D) were then assessed for their glucose lowering effects in glucose fed hyperglycemic female Wistar rats. The glucose lowering effects of compounds also confirms their potential as anti-diabetic agents.

365675,6,Confirmatory,Inhibition of DPP4,"Title: Baicalin, a prodrug able to reach the CNS, is a prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor._||_Abstract: Prolyl oligopeptidase is a cytosolic serine peptidase that hydrolyzes proline-containing peptides at the carboxy terminus of proline residues. It has been associated with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and related neuropsychiatric disorders and therefore may have important clinical implications. In a previous work, we used (19)F NMR to search for new prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors from a library of traditional Chinese medicine plant extracts, and identified several extracts as powerful inhibitors of this peptidase. Here, the flavonoid baicalin was isolated as the active component of an extract of Scutellaria baicalensis roots having prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitory activity. Baicalin inhibited prolyl oligopeptidase in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition experiments using baicalin analogs showed that the sugar moiety was not necessary for activity. The IC(50)s of baicalin and its aglycone derivative baicalein were rather similar, showing that the sugar moiety was not involved in the interaction of baicalin with POP. These results were confirmed by saturation transfer difference NMR experiments. To further understand the absorption and transport mechanisms of baicalin and baicalein, we evaluated their transport in vitro through the gastrointestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier using a Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay. The molecule which potentially crosses both barriers was identified as baicalein, the aglycone moiety of baicalin. Our results show that baicalin is a new prodrug able to inhibit prolyl oligopeptidase. As baicalin is a natural compound with a long history of safe administration to humans, it is a highly attractive base from which to develop new treatments for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and related neuropsychiatric diseases.",Journal: Bioorg.

The more recent implication of POP in cancer, together with homologous fibroblast activation protein α (FAP), implicated in tumor growth, led us to consider developing POP/FAP dual inhibitors as a promising strategy for the development of cancer therapeutics. At this stage, we thought to evaluate the requirements for selectivity of inhibitors for POP over FAP and to evaluate molecular platforms that would enable the development of selective POP and dual POP/FAP inhibitors. We report herein docking-guided design of a new bicyclic scaffold and synthesis of both covalent and non-covalent bicyclic inhibitors. Biological evaluation of first-of-their-kind [4.3.0] bicyclic compounds confirmed that reactive groups, or covalent warheads, are required for inhibitor activity. This work ultimately led to one scaffold yielding new POP-selective inhibitors and a dual inhibitor equipotent to the only drug targeting FAP and POP that ever reached clinical trials.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 240_||_First Page: 114543_||_Last Page: 114543_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114543_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5152397,20230629,20240503,6918537|6918572|11198569|44418233|46917047|66561557,103259004|103381660|103456553|103502980|123099850|160704911,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,35797897,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",3,"","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114543,"",34268640,"Plescia J, Hédou D, Pousse ME, Labarre A, Dufresne C, Mittermaier A, Moitessier N.

T2DM is a metabolic disorder, which is characterized by deficiency in insulin or resistance to insulin and thus increases the glucose levels in the blood. Various approaches are there to treat diabetes but still there is no cure for this disease. DPP-4 inhibitor is a privileged target in the field of drug discovery and provides various opportunities in exploring this target for development of molecules as antidiabetic agents. DPP-4 acts by inhibiting the incretin action and thus decreases the level of blood glucose by imparting minimal side effects. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin etc. are the different DPP-4 based drugs approved throughout the world for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Cyanopyrrolidines, triazolopiperazine amide, pyrrolidines are basic core nucleus present in various DPP-4 inhibitors and has potential effects. In the past few years, researchers had applied various approaches to synthesize potent DPP-4 inhibitors as antidiabetic agent without side effects like weight gain, cardiovascular risks, retinopathy etc. This review will also emphasize the recent strategies and rationale utilized by researchers for the development of DPP-4 inhibitors.

Dipeptide boronic acids, among the first, and still among the most potent DPP-IV inhibitors known, suffer from a concern over their safety. Here we evaluate the potency, in vivo efficacy, and safety of a selected set of these inhibitors. The adverse effects induced by boronic acid-based DPP-IV inhibitors are essentially limited to what has been observed previously for non-boronic acid inhibitors and attributed to cross-reactivity with DPP8/9. While consistent with the DPP8/9 hypothesis, they are also consistent with cross-reactivity with some other intracellular target. The results further show that the potency of simple dipeptide boronic acid-based inhibitors can be combined with selectivity against DPP8/9 in vivo to produce agents with a relatively wide therapeutic index (>500) in rodents.",Journal: J.

The availability of a DPP8-selective compound would be highly instrumental for studying and untwining the biological roles of DPP8 and DPP9 and for the disambiguation of biological effects of nonselective DPP-inhibitors that have mainly been ascribed to blocking of DPPIV's action. The cell-permeable DPP8/9-inhibitor 7 was selected as a lead and dissected into several substructures that were modified separately for evaluating their potential to contribute to selectivity. The obtained results, together with earlier work from our group, clearly narrow down the most probable DPP8-selectivity imparting modification points in DPP8/9 inhibitors to parts of space that are topologically equivalent to the piperazine ring system in 7. This information can be considered of high value for future design of compounds with maximal DPP8 selectivity.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Further modification of the pyrrolopyrimidine scaffold to produce compound 21j resulted in much better oral bioavailability than 6.

While there have been some recent commercial successes fostered in part by advances in large-scale peptide synthesis, development of peptides as therapeutic agents has been significantly impeded by their inherent susceptibility to protease degradation in the bloodstream. Here we report that incorporation of specially designed amino acid analogues at the P1' position, directly C-terminal of the enzyme cleavage site, renders peptides, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) and six other examples, highly resistant to serine protease degradation without significant alteration of their biological activity. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to a variety of proteases, including dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8), fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα), α-lytic protease (αLP), trypsin, and chymotrypsin. In summary, the 'P1' modification' represents a simple, general, and highly adaptable method of generating enzymatically stable peptide-based therapeutics.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

At physiological pH, however, it is actually more potent than L-Ala-L-boroPro, as measured by IC50 values (4.2 nM vs 1400 nM), owing to the absence of the potency-attenuating cyclization. In an interesting and at first sight surprising reversal of the relationship between stereochemistry and potency observed with the conformationally unrestrained Xaa-boroPro class of inhibitors, the L-L diastereomers of the lactams are orders of magnitude less effective than the D-L lactams.

However, these compounds showed poor oral absorption. We attempted in this study esterification of the carboxylic acid moiety to improve the compounds 1-4 plasma concentrations. Our efforts yielded 10h with a 5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxol-4-yl methyl ester as an S9/plasma-cleavable functionality. Compound 10h showed significantly high oral absorption and potent DPP-4 inhibition in vivo and decreased Zucker fatty rats glucose levels in the oral glucose tolerance test. Optimization of the ester moiety revealed that rapid conversion to the carboxyl form in both liver S9 fractions and serum was important for prodrugs not to be detected in the plasma after oral administration. In particular, lability in the serum was found to be an important characteristic. Through our investigation, we were able to develop a novel efficient synthetic method for construction of 3H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4(5H)-ones using intramolecular radical cyclization.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

The judicious introduction of fluorine into a molecule can productively influence conformation, pKa, intrinsic potency, membrane permeability, metabolic pathways, and pharmacokinetic properties. In addition, (18)F has been established as a useful positron emitting isotope for use with in vivo imaging technology that potentially has extensive application in drug discovery and development, often limited only by convenient synthetic accessibility to labeled compounds. The wide ranging applications of fluorine in drug design are providing a strong stimulus for the development of new synthetic methodologies that allow more facile access to a wide range of fluorinated compounds.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors play an increasingly important role in the treatment of T2DM because of their favorable properties of weight neutrality and hypoglycemia avoidance. Herein, we report the successful discovery and scale-up synthesis of compound 5, a structurally novel, potent, and long-acting DPP-4 inhibitor for the once-weekly treatment of T2DM. Inhibitor 5 has fast-associating and slow-dissociating binding kinetics profiles as well as slow clearance rate and long terminal half-life pharmacokinetic properties. A single-dose oral administration of 5 (3 mg/kg) inhibited >80% of DPP-4 activity for more than 7 days in diabetic mice. The long-term antidiabetic efficacies of 5 (10 mg/kg, qw) were better than those of the once-weekly trelagliptin and omarigliptin, especially in decreasing the hemoglobin A1c level.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2019_||_Volume: 62_||_Issue: 5_||_First Page: 2348_||_Last Page: 2361_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01491_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4481093,20210302,20220830,"","",1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30694668,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",4,"","",10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01491,"",11492134,"Li S, Qin C, Cui S, Xu H, Wu F, Wang J, Su M, Fang X, Li D, Jiao Q, Zhang M, Xia C, Zhu L, Wang R, Li J, Jiang H, Zhao Z, Li J, Li H.

The frequency of diagnosed cases and consequential increases in medical costs makes it a rapidly growing chronic disease that threatens human health worldwide. In addition, its unnerving statistical projections are perilous to both the economy of the nation and man's life expectancy. Type-I and type-II diabetes are the two clinical forms of diabetes mellitus. Type-II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is illustrated by the abnormality of glucose homeostasis in the body, resulting in hyperglycemia. Although significant research attention has been devoted to the development of diabetes regimens, which demonstrates success in lowering blood glucose levels, their efficacies are unsustainable due to undesirable side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Over the years, heterocyclic scaffolds have been the basis of anti-diabetic chemotherapies; hence, in this review we consolidate the use of bioactive scaffolds, which have been evaluated for their biological response as inhibitors against their respective anti-diabetic molecular targets over the past five years (2012-2017). Our investigation reveals a diverse target set which includes; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP1B), dipeptidly peptidase-4 (DPP-4), free fatty acid receptors 1 (FFAR1), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), α-glucosidase, aldose reductase, glycogen phosphorylase (GP), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), glucagon receptor (GCGr) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK).

T2DM is a metabolic disorder, which is characterized by deficiency in insulin or resistance to insulin and thus increases the glucose levels in the blood. Various approaches are there to treat diabetes but still there is no cure for this disease. DPP-4 inhibitor is a privileged target in the field of drug discovery and provides various opportunities in exploring this target for development of molecules as antidiabetic agents. DPP-4 acts by inhibiting the incretin action and thus decreases the level of blood glucose by imparting minimal side effects. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin etc. are the different DPP-4 based drugs approved throughout the world for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Cyanopyrrolidines, triazolopiperazine amide, pyrrolidines are basic core nucleus present in various DPP-4 inhibitors and has potential effects. In the past few years, researchers had applied various approaches to synthesize potent DPP-4 inhibitors as antidiabetic agent without side effects like weight gain, cardiovascular risks, retinopathy etc. This review will also emphasize the recent strategies and rationale utilized by researchers for the development of DPP-4 inhibitors.

The synthesis of the demanding tetrapeptide amide prodrug of ACV 3 was first established in solution and successfully transferred onto solid support by using Ellman's dihydropyran (DHP) resin. In contrast with the valyl ester prodrug (valacyclovir, VACV), the tetrapeptide amide prodrug 3 and the tripeptide ester conjugate 4 of ACV proved fully stable in PBS. Both prodrugs converted to VACV (for 4) or ACV (for 3) upon exposure to purified DPPIV/CD26 or human or bovine serum. Vildagliptin, a potent inhibitor of DPPIV/CD26 efficiently inhibited the DPPIV/CD26-catalysed hydrolysis reaction.

1096868,3,Confirmatory,Inhibition of DPP-4 (unknown origin) assessed as inhibition of endomorphin-1 degradation after 30 min,"Title: Kinetic studies of novel inhibitors of endomorphin degrading enzymes._||_Abstract: Endomorphins (EMs), two endogenous μ-opioid receptor selective ligands, are attractive lead compounds for opioid-based pain management studies. However, these peptides are quickly degraded by peptidases, in particular by dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) and aminopeptidase M (APM). Targeting enzymatic degradation is one approach to prolong endomorphin activity. In this study we characterized the action of two new inhibitors of similar to endomorphins structure, Tyr-Pro-Ala-NH(2) (EMDB-2) and Tyr-Pro-Ala-OH (EMDB-3), which were designed earlier in our laboratory.

T2DM is a metabolic disorder, which is characterized by deficiency in insulin or resistance to insulin and thus increases the glucose levels in the blood. Various approaches are there to treat diabetes but still there is no cure for this disease. DPP-4 inhibitor is a privileged target in the field of drug discovery and provides various opportunities in exploring this target for development of molecules as antidiabetic agents. DPP-4 acts by inhibiting the incretin action and thus decreases the level of blood glucose by imparting minimal side effects. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin etc. are the different DPP-4 based drugs approved throughout the world for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Cyanopyrrolidines, triazolopiperazine amide, pyrrolidines are basic core nucleus present in various DPP-4 inhibitors and has potential effects.

DPP IV has high substrate selectivity for peptides with a proline (or an alanine) at the penultimate amino acid position at the N-terminus but tolerates a wide range of natural amino acids at the amino terminal end. A variety of dipeptidyl amide prodrugs of anti-HIV TSAO molecules were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to act as substrates for the enzyme. Our data revealed that DPP IV/CD26 can efficiently recognize such prodrugs as substrates, releasing the parent compound. Moreover, it is possible to modify the half-life and the lipophilicity of the prodrugs by changing the nature of the dipeptide. All conjugates have shown marked in vitro antiviral activities irrespective the the nature of the terminal and/or the penultimate amino acid moiety.",Journal: J. Med.

In this study, a highly predictive CoMFA model based on the fast-docking for DPP4, DPP8, and DPP9 inhibitors was obtained. This reliable model showed leave-one-out cross-validation q(2) and conventional r(2) values of 0.68 and 0.96 for the DPP4 inhibitors, 0.58 and 0.98 for the DPP8 inhibitors, and 0.68 and 0.97 for the DPP9 inhibitors, respectively. The validation of the CoMFA model was confirmed by the compounds in the test set, including the synthesized six- and seven-membered cyclic hydrazines. According to this study, to obtain selective DPP4 inhibitors compared to their isozymes, the interaction of the inhibitors with the S3 site and S1' site in DPP4 must be considered. The proposed newly synthesized compounds, KR64300 and KR64301, interact well with the sites mentioned above, showing excellent selectivity.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg.

1053254,2,Literature-derived,Metabolic stability in human plasma assessed as half life of DPP4-mediated compound degradation,"Title: A general method for making peptide therapeutics resistant to serine protease degradation: application to dipeptidyl peptidase IV substrates._||_Abstract: Bioactive peptides have evolved to optimally fulfill specific biological functions, a fact which has long attracted attention for their use as therapeutic agents. While there have been some recent commercial successes fostered in part by advances in large-scale peptide synthesis, development of peptides as therapeutic agents has been significantly impeded by their inherent susceptibility to protease degradation in the bloodstream. Here we report that incorporation of specially designed amino acid analogues at the P1' position, directly C-terminal of the enzyme cleavage site, renders peptides, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) and six other examples, highly resistant to serine protease degradation without significant alteration of their biological activity. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to a variety of proteases, including dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DPP8), fibroblast activation protein α (FAPα), α-lytic protease (αLP), trypsin, and chymotrypsin. In summary, the 'P1' modification' represents a simple, general, and highly adaptable method of generating enzymatically stable peptide-based therapeutics.",Journal: J. Med.

The assay enabled the fast determination of multiple IC<sub>50</sub>s by simply incubating a solution of phosphate-buffered saline in a 96-well plate within 30 min. The substrate specificity, cross-reaction and other related conditions were systematically optimized. This method was successfully applied to determine the IC<sub>50</sub>s of seven known inhibitors.

The aggrecanase ADAMTS-5 is key in the degradation of human aggrecan (AGC), a component of cartilage. Therefore, ADAMTS-5 is a promising target for the identification of DMOADs. We describe the discovery of GLPG1972/S201086, a potent and selective ADAMTS-5 inhibitor obtained by optimization of a promising hydantoin series following an HTS. Biochemical activity against rat and human ADAMTS-5 was assessed via a fluorescence-based assay. ADAMTS-5 inhibitory activity was confirmed with human aggrecan using an AGC ELISA. The most promising compounds were selected based on reduction of glycosaminoglycan release after interleukin-1 stimulation in mouse cartilage explants and led to the discovery of GLPG1972/S201086. The anticatabolic activity was confirmed in mouse cartilage explants (IC<sub>50</sub> < 1.5 μM). The cocrystal structure of GLPG1972/S201086 with human recombinant ADAMTS-5 is discussed. GLPG1972/S201086 has been investigated in a phase 2 clinical study in patients with knee OA (NCT03595618).",Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 64_||_Issue: 6.0_||_First Page: 2937_||_Last Page: 2952_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c02008_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4835183,20220830,20220830,121448841|137468159,469803336|469814553,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33719441,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","","","","",10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c02008,"",14953647,"Brebion F, Gosmini R, Deprez P, Varin M, Peixoto C, Alvey L, Jary H, Bienvenu N, Triballeau N, Blanque R, Cottereaux C, Christophe T, Vandervoort N, Mollat P, Touitou R, Leonard P, De Ceuninck F, Botez I, Monjardet A, van der Aar E, Amantini D.

Pseudoprolines are a family of Pro isosteres that incorporate a heteroatom, most prominently oxygen or sulfur but also silicon and selenium, to replace the C<sub>β</sub> or C<sub>γ</sub> carbon atom of the pyrrolidine ring. These readily synthetically accessible structural motifs can facilitate facile molecular editing in a fashion that allows modulation of the amide bond topology of dipeptide elements and influence over ring pucker. While the properties of pseudoprolines have been exploited most prominently in the design of oligopeptide analogues, they have potential application in the design and optimization of small molecules. In this Digest, we summarize the physicochemical properties of pseudoprolines and illustrate their potential in drug discovery by surveying examples of applications in the design of bioactive molecules.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Bioorg Med Chem Lett_||_Year: 2022_||_Volume: 75_||_First Page: 128983_||_Last Page: 128983_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmcl.2022.128983_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5229295,20240503,20240503,171349047|171350070,494405537|494407252,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,36096342,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",2,"","",10.1016/j.bmcl.2022.128983,"",34997812,"Kashif Khan R, Meanwell NA, Hager HH.

Many N-heterocycles display numerous biological activities. Among condensed heterocycles, pyrazolotriazine derivatives have received the attention of researchers owing to the extensive spectrum of biological activities. The reactivity of identified compounds was similar to the free azoles and triazines. The pyrazolotriazine scaffold exhibited antiasthma, antiinﬂammatory, anticancer, antithrombogenic activity and showed activity for major depression and pathological anxiety. Pyrazolotriazine derivatives also exhibited antibacterial, anticancer, antimetabolites, antidiabetic, antiamoebic, anticonvulsant, antiproliferative activity, human carbonic anhydrase inhibition, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibition, tyrosinase and urease inhibition, MAO-B inhibition, TTK inhibition, thymidine phosphorylase inhibition, tubulin polymerization inhibition, protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibition, GABA<sub>A</sub> agonistic activity, hCRF1 receptor antagonistic activity, and CGRP receptor antagonistic activity.

Here we describe a new family of specific and irreversible inhibitors of this enzyme. Taking into account the substrate specificity of DPP IV for P2-P1><-P1' cleavage, we have designed and synthesized cyclopeptides c[(alphaH2N+)-Lys-Pro-Aba-(6-CH2-S+R2)-Glyn] 2TFA- (Aba = 3-aminobenzoic acid, R = alkyl) possessing a proline at the P1 position and a lysine in the P2 position, which allows the closing of the cycle on its side chain. These molecules show a free N-terminus, necessary for binding to the CD26 catalytic site, and a latent quinoniminium methide electrophile, responsible for inactivation. Treatment of c[alphaZ-Lys-Pro-Aba-(6-CH2-OC6H5)-Glyn], obtained by peptide synthesis in solution, with R2S/TFA simutaneously cleaved the Z protecting group and the phenyl ether function and led to a series of cyclopeptide sulfonium salts. These cyclopeptides inhibited rapidly and irreversibly the DPP IV activity of CD26, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. Further studies were carried out to investigate the effect of the modification of the ring size (n = 2 or 4) and the nature of the sulfur substituents (R = Me, Bu, Oct). Cycle enlargement improved the inhibitory activity of the methylsulfonio cyclopeptide, whereas the increase of the alkyl chain length on the sulfur atom had no apparent effect. Other aminopeptidases were not inhibited, and a much weaker activity was observed on a novel isoform of DPP IV referred to as DPP IV-beta.

Despite poor systemic exposure, vinyl-substituted compounds showed extended duration of action in acute rat ex vivo plasma DPP-IV inhibition models. Oxygenated putative metabolites were prepared and were shown to exhibit the potency and extended duration of action of their precursors in efficacy models measuring glucose clearance in Zucker(fa/fa) rats.

A novel series of cis-2,5-dicyanopyrrolidine alpha-amino amides were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 1-({[1-(Hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl]amino}acetyl)pyrrolidine-2,5-cis-dicarbonitrile (1c) is an achiral, slow-binding (time-dependent) inhibitor of DPP-IV that is selective for DPP-IV over other DPP isozymes and proline specific serine proteases, and which has oral bioavailability in preclinical species and in vivo efficacy in animal models. The mode of binding of the cis-2,5-dicyanopyrrolidine moiety was determined by X-ray crystallography.

Efficient procedures have been developed for the synthesis of dipeptide and tetrapeptide amide prodrugs including N-acylation protocols of the exocyclic amino function of cytidine and adenosine nucleosides. Our studies demonstrated that XaaPro dipeptides linked to a free amino group present on an aromatic ring or on a sugar entity are prodrugs that efficiently release the parent drug upon conversion by purified DPPIV/CD26 as well as soluble DPPIV/CD26 in bovine and human serum. Vildagliptin, a specific inhibitor of DPPIV/CD26, was able to completely block the hydrolysis of the prodrugs in the presence of purified CD26 but also in human and bovine serum. When the amino group is present on a pyrimidine or purine ring, the dipeptide derivatives are chemically unstable, whereas the tetrapeptide derivatives (i.e., ValProValPro or ValAlaValPro) were much more stable in solution and efficiently converted to the parent drug by the action of DPPIV/CD26. This DPPIV/CD26-directed prodrug technology can be useful to increase solubility of the parent drug molecules and/or to allow better formulation properties.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies and X-ray cocrystal structure analysis allowed a detailed assessment of critical and tunable structural elements. To realize the therapeutic potential of these cyclodepsipeptides, we probed the cellular effects of a novel and representative family member, symplostatin 5 (1), which attenuated the downstream cellular effects of elastase in an epithelial lung airway model system, alleviating clinical hallmarks of chronic pulmonary diseases such as cell death, cell detachment, and inflammation. This compound attenuated the effects of elastase on receptor activation, proteolytic processing of the adhesion protein ICAM-1, NF-κB activation, and transcriptomic changes, including the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1A, IL1B, and IL8. Compound 1 exhibited activity comparable to the clinically approved elastase inhibitor sivelestat in short-term assays and demonstrated superior sustained activity in longer-term assays.",Journal: J.

Followup work by Calderon et al. clustered and computationally filtered the TCAMS through a variety of criteria and reported 47 series containing a total of 522 compounds. From this enhanced set, we identified the carbamoyl triazole TCMDC-134379 (1), a known serine protease inhibitor, as an excellent starting point for SAR profiling. Lead optimization of 1 led to several molecules with improved antimalarial potency, metabolic stabilities in mouse and human liver microsomes, along with acceptable cytotoxicity profiles. Analogue 44 displayed potent in vitro activity (IC50 = 10 nM) and oral activity in a SCID mouse model of Pf infection with an ED50 of 100 and ED90 of between 100 and 150 mg kg(-1), respectively.

The judicious introduction of fluorine into a molecule can productively influence conformation, pKa, intrinsic potency, membrane permeability, metabolic pathways, and pharmacokinetic properties. In addition, (18)F has been established as a useful positron emitting isotope for use with in vivo imaging technology that potentially has extensive application in drug discovery and development, often limited only by convenient synthetic accessibility to labeled compounds. The wide ranging applications of fluorine in drug design are providing a strong stimulus for the development of new synthetic methodologies that allow more facile access to a wide range of fluorinated compounds. In this review, we provide an update on the effects of the strategic incorporation of fluorine in drug molecules and applications in positron emission tomography.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J.

The in vitro screening of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activated activity, α-glucosidase inhibitory and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitory activities showed that the novel molecule M5 had efficient PPAR response element (PPRE) activated activity (PPRE relative activity 105.04% at 10 μg·mL-1 compared with the positive control pioglitazone, with 100% activity). Therefore, M5 was selected as the hit compound from which the TM3 and TM4 series of compounds were further designed and synthesized. Based on the PPRE relative activities of TM3 and TM4, we discovered another new molecule, TM4h, which had the strongest PPRE relative activity (120.42% at 10 μg·mL-1). In addition, the concentration-dependent activity of the highly active compounds was determined by assaying their half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values. The molecular physical parameter calculation and the molecular toxicity prediction were used to theoretically evaluate the lead-likeness and safety of the active compounds. In conclusion, we identified a potential PPARγ lead molecule and developed a tangible strategy for antidiabetic drug development.",Journal: Bioorg Med Chem_||_Year: 2018_||_Volume: 26_||_Issue: 14_||_First Page: 4153_||_Last Page: 4167_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.bmc.2018.07.005_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4233585,20200619,20200619,11403745,103450673,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30001846,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","","","","",10.1016/j.bmc.2018.07.005,"",7444158,"Liu J, Su X, Li H, Fan L, Li Y, Tang X, Yan J, Chen X, Chen F, Liu J, Yang D.

Symploca sp. collected in American Samoa. The structure of 1 was established by detailed 1D and 2D NMR experiments, HRESIMS data, and chemical degradation/chromatographic (e.g., Marfey's analysis) studies. Pure compound 1 was shown to have in vitro cytotoxic activity against several human cancer cell lines in both traditional cell culture and zone inhibition bioassays.

Our own interest in the development of prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) and fibroblast activation protein α (FAP) covalent inhibitors has led us to question whether these two serine proteases were equal in terms of their reactivity toward electrophilic warheads. To streamline such investigations, we exploited both computational and experimental methods to investigate the influence of different reactive groups on both potency and binding kinetics using both our own series of POP inhibitors and others' discovered hits. A direct correlation between inhibitor reactivity and residence time was demonstrated through quantum mechanics methods and further supported by experimental studies. This computational method was also successfully applied to FAP, as an overview of known FAP inhibitors confirmed our computational predictions that more reactive warheads (e.g., boronic acids) must be employed to inhibit FAP than for POP.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2019_||_Volume: 62_||_Issue: 17_||_First Page: 7874_||_Last Page: 7884_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00642_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4336750,20210302,20220830,"","",1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31393718,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",1,"","",10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00642,"",10149618,"Plescia J, De Cesco S, Patrascu MB, Kurian J, Di Trani J, Dufresne C, Wahba AS, Janmamode N, Mittermaier AK, Moitessier N.

These peptides, upon hydrolysis, can exert positive physiological effects on human health, different from that of their native protein. These effects are brought about by their interaction with specific targets in the body, thereby, mimicking physiologically relevant peptides. Peptides are derived from food proteins, they are popular natural alternatives for the management of common metabolic disorders. In the present study, we aimed to identify bioactive peptide sequences (less than 3 kDa) from fat globule membrane protein (FGMP) hydrolysates of buffalo colostrum using a combination of empirical, computational and in vitro methods.

After systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study around benzoic acid moieties, 5 novel DPP-4 inhibitors with low picomolar potency range (IC<sub>50</sub> < 1 nM) and excellent selectivity against various DPP-4 homologues were identified, in which the best one, compound 2f, with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.1 nM for DPP-4, showed 22-fold improvement in inhibitory activity compared to lead compound uracil 1, its activity was 45-fold more potent than alogliptin. 2e, 2f, 2i and 2k were selected for pharmacokinetic evaluation, and 2f and 2i showed the better pharmacokinetic profiles after iv administration, but poor oral bioavailability. To improve the oral pharmacokinetic profile, prodrug design approach was performed around 2f and 2i. Esters of 2f and 2i were synthesized and evaluated for stability, toxicity and pharmacokinetics. Compound 3e, the methyl ester of compound 2f, was identified to demonstrate good stability, low toxicity and improved oral bioavailability, with 3-fold higher blood concentration compared to 2f in rats. The following in vivo evaluations revealed 3e provided a sustained pharmacodynamics effect for 48h, and robustly improved glucose tolerance in normal ICR and db/db mice in dose-dependent manner. Chronic treatments investigations demonstrated that 3e achieved more beneficial effects on fasting blood glucose levels and glucose tolerance than alogliptin in type 2 diabetic db/db mice.

Long-acting antidiabetic drugs are clinically needed for improving patients' compliance. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors play an increasingly important role in the treatment of T2DM because of their favorable properties of weight neutrality and hypoglycemia avoidance. Herein, we report the successful discovery and scale-up synthesis of compound 5, a structurally novel, potent, and long-acting DPP-4 inhibitor for the once-weekly treatment of T2DM. Inhibitor 5 has fast-associating and slow-dissociating binding kinetics profiles as well as slow clearance rate and long terminal half-life pharmacokinetic properties. A single-dose oral administration of 5 (3 mg/kg) inhibited >80% of DPP-4 activity for more than 7 days in diabetic mice.

For all approved therapeutic agents, the time frame has been extended to cover the almost 39 years from the first of January 1981 to the 30th of September 2019 for all diseases worldwide and from ∼1946 (earliest so far identified) to the 30th of September 2019 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. As in earlier reviews, only the first approval of any drug is counted, irrespective of how many 'biosimilars' or added approvals were subsequently identified. As in the 2012 and 2016 reviews, we have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a 'natural product mimic', or 'NM', to join the original primary divisions, and the designation 'natural product botanical', or 'NB', to cover those botanical 'defined mixtures' now recognized as drug entities by the FDA (and similar organizations). From the data presented in this review, the utilization of natural products and/or synthetic variations using their novel structures, in order to discover and develop the final drug entity, is still alive and well. For example, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from 1946 to 1980, of the 75 small molecules, 40, or 53.3%, are N or ND. In the 1981 to date time frame the equivalent figures for the N* compounds of the 185 small molecules are 62, or 33.5%, though to these can be added the 58 S* and S*/NMs, bringing the figure to 64.9%. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked with, as expected from prior information, the anti-infective area being dependent on natural products and their structures, though as can be seen in the review there are still disease areas (shown in Table 2) for which there are no drugs derived from natural products. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have been used very successfully in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are still able to identify only two de novo combinatorial compounds (one of which is a little speculative) approved as drugs in this 39-year time frame, though there is also one drug that was developed using the 'fragment-binding methodology' and approved in 2012. We have also added a discussion of candidate drug entities currently in clinical trials as 'warheads' and some very interesting preliminary reports on sources of novel antibiotics from Nature due to the absolute requirement for new agents to combat plasmid-borne resistance genes now in the general populace. We continue to draw the attention of readers to the recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the 'host from whence it was isolated'; thus we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.",Journal: J Nat Prod_||_Year: 2020_||_Volume: 83_||_Issue: 3_||_First Page: 770_||_Last Page: 803_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b01285_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4611888,20210802,20210802,15983988,124969260,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32162523,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","","","","",10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b01285,"",14901438,"Newman DJ, Cragg GM.

Anti-diabetic drugs are used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus to control glucose levels in the blood. Most of the drugs are administered orally, except for a few of them, such as insulin, exenatide, and pramlintide. In this review, we are going to discuss seven major types of anti-diabetic drugs: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors, aldose reductase inhibitors, α-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) inhibitors.

Herein, with scaffold hopping and fragment-based drug design strategies, highly potent and selective pyrazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidine DPP-4 inhibitors were found featured by reduced or diminished cytotoxicity. Specifically, c24 (IC = 2 nM) exhibits a 25 to 40-fold increase of inhibitory activity respect to those of b2 and d1, respectively, 2-fold from Alogliptin (IC = 4 nM), and remarkable selectivity over DPP-8 and DPP-9 (>2000 fold). Further docking studies confirmed that the pyrazolo [1,5-a]pyrimidine core interacts with the S1 pocket whereas its substituted aromatic ring interacts with the sub-S1 pocket. The interactive mode in this case resembles that of Alogliptin and Trelagliptin. Further in vivo IPGTT assays in diabetic mice demonstrated that c24 effectively reduces glucose excursion by 48% at the dose of 10 mg/kg, suggesting that c24 is worthy of further development as a potent anti-diabetes agent.",Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2020_||_Volume: 208_||_First Page: 112850_||_Last Page: 112850_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112850_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4711309,20220318,20220318,162666659,461548238,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32987315,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","","","","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.112850,"",12921471,"Shen J, Deng X, Sun R, Tavallaie MS, Wang J, Cai Q, Lam C, Lei S, Fu L, Jiang F.

1915713,1,Confirmatory,Inhibition of DPP4 (unknown origin),"Title: Therapeutic progression of quinazolines as targeted chemotherapeutic agents._||_Abstract: Presently cancer is a grave health issue with predominance beyond restrictions. It can affect any organ of the body. Most of the available chemotherapeutic drugs are highly toxic, not much selective and eventually lead to the development of resistance. Therefore, a target specific palliative approach for the treatment of cancer is required. Remarkable advancements in science have illuminated various molecular pathways responsible for cancer. This has resulted in abundant opportunities to develop targeted anticancer agents. Quinazoline nucleus is a privileged scaffold with significant diversified pharmacological activities. Numerous established anticancer quinazoline derivatives constitute a new class of chemotherapeutic agents which are found to act by inhibiting various protein kinases as well as other molecular targets. A recent update on various quinazoline derivatives acting on different types of molecular targets for the treatment of cancer has been compiled in this review. Brief SAR studies of quinazoline derivatives acting through different mechanisms of action have been highlighted. The comprehensive medicinal chemistry aspects of these agents in this review provide a panoramic view to the biologists as well as medicinal chemists working in this area and would assist them in their efforts to design and synthesize novel quinazoline based anticancer compounds.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: Eur J Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 211_||_First Page: 113016_||_Last Page: 113016_||_DOI: 10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113016_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5215235,20230629,20230629,10096344,103537922,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33243532,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",1,"","",10.1016/j.ejmech.2020.113016,"",3351759,"Bansal R, Malhotra A.

Although significant research attention has been devoted to the development of diabetes regimens, which demonstrates success in lowering blood glucose levels, their efficacies are unsustainable due to undesirable side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. Over the years, heterocyclic scaffolds have been the basis of anti-diabetic chemotherapies; hence, in this review we consolidate the use of bioactive scaffolds, which have been evaluated for their biological response as inhibitors against their respective anti-diabetic molecular targets over the past five years (2012-2017). Our investigation reveals a diverse target set which includes; protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP1B), dipeptidly peptidase-4 (DPP-4), free fatty acid receptors 1 (FFAR1), G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2), α-glucosidase, aldose reductase, glycogen phosphorylase (GP), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), glucagon receptor (GCGr) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK).

This opinion is largely a function of the perception that such motifs might be chemically unstable under the acidic conditions of the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract. However, even simple acetals and ketals, including acyclic molecules, can be sufficiently robust under acidic conditions to be fashioned into orally bioavailable drugs, and these structural elements are embedded in many effective therapeutic agents. The chemical stability of molecules incorporating geminal diheteroatomic motifs can be modulated by physicochemical design principles that include the judicious deployment of proximal electron-withdrawing substituents and conformational restriction. In this Perspective, we exemplify geminal diheteroatomic motifs that have been utilized in the discovery of orally bioavailable drugs or drug candidates against the backdrop of understanding their potential for chemical lability.",Compounds with activity <= 10uM or explicitly reported as active by ChEMBL are flagged as active in this PubChem assay presentation._||_Journal: J Med Chem_||_Year: 2021_||_Volume: 64_||_Issue: 14.0_||_First Page: 9786_||_Last Page: 9874_||_DOI: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00790_||_Target ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL284_||_ChEMBL Target Name: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV_||_ChEMBL Target Type: SINGLE PROTEIN - Target is a single protein chain_||_Relationship Type: D - Direct protein target assigned_||_Confidence: Direct single protein target assigned,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL5247134,20240503,20240503,10439426,242097838,1803,"",P27487,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,34213340,0,3.4.14.5,P27487,9606,"","",1,"","",10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00790,"",33842007,"Wu YJ, Meanwell NA.
